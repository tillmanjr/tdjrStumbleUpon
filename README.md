StumbleUpon is shutting eoJune '18. Stuff to grab my likes and lists and display them

cobbled together quickly

index.js has utils for getting files and parsing from Stumble upon.
results written to console
store files ./server/data ... see server
simple node server to allow serving from file system (darn Chrome :) )
StumbleUpon.html to display in nice Tabulator table
